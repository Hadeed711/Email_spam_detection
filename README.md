# 📧 Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning

This project is part of my internship at **DataZenix Solutions**.  
It focuses on detecting spam emails using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques.

## 🚀 Project Overview
Spam emails are a widespread problem, often containing scams, phishing content, or unwanted advertisements.  
In this project, we built an ML pipeline to classify emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam**.

## 🛠 Features
✔️ Text preprocessing (stopwords removal, lemmatization, cleaning)  
✔️ Model building with pipelines (Naive Bayes & RandomForest)  
✔️ Evaluation through cross-validation & visualizations  
✔️ Testing the model on unseen emails

## 📊 Results
- **Accuracy**: ~97% (Naive Bayes baseline)  
- **F1 Score**: High performance across models  
- Visualized metrics with confusion matrix and classification report
